# Homework 1 - Week 3

![Python package](https://github.com/vcueasterlingkh/root_homework1/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg)

![Pylint](https://github.com/vcueasterlingkh/root_homework1/workflows/Pylint/badge.svg)

![Super-Linter](https://github.com/vcueasterlingkh/root_homework1/workflows/Super-Linter/badge.svg)

For your homework, fork this repository to your account.

Updated the 'README.md' file to change the URLs for the github actions:

https://github.com/vcueasterlingkh/root_homework1/workflows/Pylint/badge.svg

should become

https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT/root_homework1/workflows/Pylint/badge.svg

Edit the file ./homework1/hw1.py to make the three github actions pass.

When they pass, and you see the updated badges in your repository, send me a link to the repository, like:

https://github.com/vcu-chfauerbach/root_homework1

but

https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT/root_homework1
